# Special Season Project Overview

This document describes the requirements for project for the Network and Computer Security / Segurança Informática em Redes e Sistemas (SIRS) course for the Special Evaluation Season.

The project is done by a **single student**.

## 1. Calendar

The **special season** begins on Wednesday, July 21st, 2021.
However, we recommend that you request the **project statement** earlier, starting: **Monday, July 12th, 2021**.

To make the request, send an e-mail to [meic-sirs@disciplinas.tecnico.ulisboa.pt](mailto:meic-sirs@disciplinas.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) with the subject `SIRS EE inscr proj ist12345` with your IST identifier.
The body of the e-mail should contain the topic proposals (more details follow).

The project delivery is on: **Thursday, July 26th, 2021, 12:00** (noon).
The project discussions start in the afternoon of the same day and in the next day, if necessary.

The special season exam is on Wednesday, July 28th, 2021.
The special season concludes on July 30th, 2021.

## 2. Proposal

The project proposal e-mail, mentioned above, must contain **two** distinct **topic proposals**.

The topics can be chosen for past SIRS project topics or self-proposed by the student, in an area of interest in the topics covered by the course.

Each project proposal should describe the problem and the proposed solution in around 200 words.  
The project will need to have, _at least_:

- a secure communication tunnel (e.g. TLS, SSH) using correct configuration;
- the design and deployment of one mechanism using a custom security protocol.

## 3. Approval

The proposal will need to be selected, modified and approved by the course faculty.
After the e-mail with the proposals is received and analyzed, a short meeting will be scheduled to settle and oficialize the topic.

## 4. Discussion

Each student will have to prepare a presentation and demonstration of the work.
The recommended duration is 5 minutes for presentation, and 5 minutes for demonstration.

The presentation must include slides describing, _at least_:

- the general architecture;
- the initial key distribution and management mechanism;
- the design of the custom security protocol in detail.

## 5. Final remarks

The special season project will allow you to explore and learn a specific topic, in-depth.
Make the most of the learning experience and ask for our feedback as much as possible.
